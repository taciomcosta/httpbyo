## dnsbyo

## Motivation
httpbyo is a personal learning project to understand how HTTP servers work under the hood.
You will find other repositories suffixed with byo, which references [Build your Own X](https://github.com/danistefanovic/build-your-own-x).

I've created this series of small projects to experiement a new way of learning new things, by building a prototype of everything I wish to learn.

I intend to follow most part of [this](https://roadmap.sh/backend) roadmap. So there will probably be a 'byo' project for many of the boxes presented on that roadmap.

## Try it

Open a terminal window and run:

```
make
```

The server is now running on port 8080.

*/view/:page* */edit/:page* are the available pages.


Open a browser and access *localhost:8080/view/mynewpage*

## TODO
- [x] Implement basic HTTP Server
- [x] Render templates
- [x] Restrict available paths
